# Project2

I am having to send this email from a non-BU domain because BU mail system would not let me automatically generate and email binaries.
Project 2 is a bomb project. The bomb is a file and the goal is to provide inputs that 'diffuse' the bomb. THE BOMB ONLY WORKS ON REMOTE.CS.
Each student is expected to work on the project individually.
It comprises of multiple phases that you are required to solve. The phases are labelled Phase 0, 1, 2, and so on.
A phase is considered solved ONLY IF the string "Phase x solved." is printed where x is 0, 1, 2, etc. Phase 0 is worth 10 points. The rest are worth 20 points each.

The inputs to the program may either be provided on the terminal or through an input file.
You may skip phases that you find hard to solve. This will allow you to attempt latter phases. In oder to skip a phase, provide the word "resign" as input for the phase.
Before you begin, ensure that the md5 checksum of the binary matches the checksum provided below.

Before running the bomb, make it executable by running "$ chmod +x bomb". 

Create a text file called "project2.txt" that is the solution your bomb. Submit the file on Brightspace. To grade your project, your "project2.txt" will be provided as command line input to your bomb. It is your responsibility to ensure that the file is correct.

Furthermore, the bomb is generated for the bash shell. Although it might work just fine with other shells, you are advised to work on bash. "$ bash" on remote.cs.binghamton.edu will enter bash shell.
